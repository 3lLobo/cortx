## IPFS

To spin up an IPFS node on the browser, use the `create()` from ipfs-core.
To connect to a running node on localhost, use the ipfs-http-client library like [here](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs-http-client)

The browser extension can not be connected to as it runs in Braves native IPFS mode, which refuses API connections.
Switching this to `local` will make it connectable.
