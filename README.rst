CORTX: World's First Scalable Mass-Capacity Object Storage System
==============================================================================

The volume of data created and collected worlwide is massively increasing. In comparision, the proportion of data that is being stored is miniscule. The machine learning models that are at the forefront of most significant research studies today, depend on access to compete data sets. Retaining such a large volume of data necessitates hardware innovations for high areal density per cost and new software architecture, which are prohibitively expensive. 

We enable research that is changing the world by creating ingenious storage solutions that are efficient and economical.

The CORTX Project
-----------------

CORTX is a distributed object storage system designed for efficiency, mass-capacity, and high HDD-utilization. Our goal is to create storage solution with maximum utilization and high code-quality. 

CORTX Project Scope and Core Design Goals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to create a solution that is:

- Processor Agnostic: adapts to any processor. 
  
- Flexible â€“ works with HDD, SSD, and NVM.

- Massively Scalable: scales up to a billion billion billion billion billion exabytes (2^206) and 1.3 billion billion billion billion (2^120) objects with unlimited object sizes.

- Rapidly Responsive: quickly retrieves data regardless of the scale using a novel Key Value System that ensures low search latency across massive data sets.

- Highly Resilient: ensures high tolerance for hardware failure and faster rebuild and recovery times using Network Erasure Coding ensure, while remaining fully RAID-compatible.

- Transparent: provides specialized telemetry data and an unmatched insight into system performance.
