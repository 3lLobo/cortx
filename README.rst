CORTX. Hyperscale storage stack capabilities for all.
=====================================================

In consultation with IDC, Seagate has determined that by 2025, an immense amount of data, approximately 175 zettabytes will be created. Surprisingly, only 10% or 17 out of 175 zettabytes of data will be retained. IDC predicts that this 158 zettabytes of unretained data, has tremendous unrealized potential. Multiple research efforts conclude that machine learning and data analytics accuracy is directly correlated to the size of the input data set.

Retaining such a large volume of data necessitates hardware innovations for high areal density per cost and new software architecture, which are prohibitively expensive. Developing a new software architecture that ensures efficient utilization of co-evolving hardware innovations and mitigates the economic limitations of existing systems is the imminent need of the hour. 

The CORTX Project
-----------------
Seagate has developed CORTX after diligently understanding the software and hardware specifications required to retain large amounts of data. CORTX is a distributed object storage system designed for efficiency, mass-capacity, and high HDD-utilization. The CORTX project is focussed on achieving goals such as maximum utilization of storage with high code-quality that prevents vendor lock-ins.
