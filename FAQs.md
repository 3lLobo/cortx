**Q** What does CORTX stand for?

**A** Actually CORTX is not an acronym.  We choose the name as a modification of the word 'cortex' which is a part of the brain.  This reflects our vision that CORTX is a next-generation, _intelligent_, object storage system that is also well-suited for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads.  We use CORTX as a stylized view of 'cortex' for purely aesthetic reasons.

Please help us populate this FAQ by letting us know what you most want to know about CORTX!  Feel free to ask questions in any of our [communications channels](SUPPORT.md) and we can all populate this FAQ as we learned what is actually frequently asked.
