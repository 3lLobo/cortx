CORTX QUICK START GUIDE
=======================

In order to contribute to CORTX, the first thing to understand is that CORTX Community is currently comprised of two main pieces.  The first is mero and it is the central component providing object and key-value storage.  The second component is our S3 interface to mero.  Contributions are welcome in either or both of the components.

1. Set up your [build and test environment](BUILD_ENVIRONMENT.md)
2. Configure your VM
3. [Getting mero ready](MeroQuickStart.md)
4. [Getting S3 ready](S3QuickStart.md)
5. [Ideas for contributions](SuggestedContributions.md)
6. Submitting contributions [link to demo video](https://seagatetechnology.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/CORTX/Shared%20Documents/EOS-Training/EOS%20Core%20Training/Codacy%20work%20sync.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=QQcePf)
