CI/CD and other Automation
==========================

Codacy
------
CORTX is currently integrated with [Codacy](http://codacy.com) for automated static code analysis of both our Mero and S3 submodules.  
The Codacy report for Mero can be found [here](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Seagate/mero/dashboard).  The Codacy report for S3 can be found [here](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Seagate/S3server/dashboard).  And, finally, the Codacy report for this parent repository can be found [here](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Seagate/cortx/dashboard).

TODO
----
Add more automation and document them here.
