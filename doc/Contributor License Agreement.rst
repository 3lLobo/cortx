===================================
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
===================================
A Contributor License Agreement defines the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the Cortx project. Cortx would not accept pull requests or other contributions to the open-source projects on GitHub until you sign the CLA. GitHub is associated with a bot that automates CLAs and the necessary procedures.

*************
Role of CLA
*************
The CLA assures the following:

- Contributor is the author of the contribution
- Contributor has the legal right to grant the copyright license
- Contributor does not have an employer that can claim rights in the copyright
- Contribution is not subject to third-party licenses, claims, suits, or actions.


**********************
Functioning of CLA Bot
**********************
cla-bot is a GitHub Application for automation of Contributor Licence Agreements (CLAs). It checks whether contributors have signed an agreement, adding labels to PRs if they have, or prompting for signature if they have not.


If you have any queries with regards to cla, please send a mail to cla@seagate.com.
