Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
===================================
A Contributor License Agreement defines the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the Cortx project. Cortx would not accept pull requests or other contributions to the open-source projects on GitHub until you sign the CLA. GitHub is associated with a bot that automates CLAs and the necessary procedures. To know more about the cla-bot, refer `CLA Bot <https://colineberhardt.github.io/cla-bot/>`_.
