===================================
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
===================================
A Contributor License Agreement defines the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the Cortx project. Cortx would not accept pull requests or other contributions to the open-source projects on GitHub until you sign the CLA. GitHub is associated with a bot that automates CLAs and the necessary procedures.

**********************
Functioning of CLA Bot
**********************
cla-bot is a GitHub Application for automation of Contributor Licence Agreements (CLAs). It checks whether contributors have signed an agreement, adding labels to PRs if they have, or prompting for signature if they have not.

Once you have added this application, you need to add a **.clabot** file to your repository, which provides details of contributors who have a signed CLA. Refer `cla-bot <https://colineberhardt.github.io/cla-bot/>`_ to know more about installing and configuring the bot with your repository.

If you have any queries with regards to cla, please send a mail [cla@seagate.com](mailto:cla@seagate.com).
