### BUILD AND TEST ENVIRONMENT FOR CORTX

Building and testing CORTX can be done using a single system.  Obviously CORTX is designed to be a scale-out distributed object storage system but these instructions currently only cover setting up a single node environment.

Currently CORTX requires the CentOS 7.7.1908 distribution running the 3.10.0-1062 kernel. Building it and testing it can be done on either a physical or virtual machine matching these requirements.  

Please refer to [this page](LocalVMSetup.md) for information about running with VMWare Fusion or Virtual Box as well as links to downloadable VM images which you can use.  

Planning to create your own VM, please check [this page](VIRTUAL_MACHINE.md) for helpful pre-build steps pertaining to motr, s3server and hare. It also contains information to resolve a few issues that can come up at runtime.

We have provided instructions to [install dependencies](InstallingDependencies.md).

A CORTX development environment requires RoCEâ€”RDMA over Converged Ethernet and TCP connectivity.
   - Note: The CORTX stack currently does not work on Intel's OmniPath cards.
