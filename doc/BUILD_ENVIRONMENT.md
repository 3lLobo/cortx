### BUILD AND TEST ENVIRONMENT FOR CORTX

Building and testing CORTX can be done using a single system.  Obviously CORTX is designed to be a scale-out distributed object storage system but these instructions currently only cover setting up a single node environment.

Currently CORTX requires the CentOS 7.7.1908 distribution running the 3.10.0-1062.12.1 kernel.  Building it and testing it can be done on either a physical or virtual machine matching these requirements.

TODO:
1. Provide a downloadable image for Virtual Box and any necessary instructions.
2. Provide a downloadable image for Windows Subsystem Linux and any necessary instructions.

If you are unable to procure your own build system, a small number of supported virtual machines can be made available on a limited first come first serve basis.  Unfortunately this offer is only possible for Seagate employees and contractors.  Please click [here](DEV_VM.md) for instructions about how to request one.
