CORTX Quickstart Guide
#######################

To contribute to the CORTX Open-Source project, you'll need to understand the way the CORTX repository is organized. 

The CORTX repository is the first and the parent repository that contains top-level documentation about the CORTX Community. The CORTX-Motr repository contains Motr files and is the second component of the CORTX project. Motr is the central component that stores Objects and Key-Values. The S3 Server component is built on Motr and all component related information is posited in the CORTX-S3 Server repository. 

Let's get CORTX ready!
======================

**Before you Begin**

You'll need to `Build and Test your VM Environment <../master/doc/BUILD_ENVIRONMENT.md>`_

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Since CORTX is composed of the Motr and S3 Server components, you'll need to:

1. `Set up CORTX-Motr <../master/doc/CortxMotrQuickStart.md>`_

2. `Get CORTX-S3 Server ready <../cortx-s3server/dev/docs/CORTX-S3 Server Quick Start Guide.md>`_

Watch our CORTX Engineer, Kevin Price, demonstrate **<link to the video>** the process.
